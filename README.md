### <b>hello, world!</b>
My name is Pete. I'm a 16 year old high school student who intends
to major in computer science and engineering.

I've been programming and tinkering with computer hardware as a passion since I was eight years old.
The idea of computers having the potential to solve many of the world's problems is fascinating to me.

I plan on using GitHub as a base for my portfolio, containing all of my open source work and demonstrating my ability to collaborate with others.
